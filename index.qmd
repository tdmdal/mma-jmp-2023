### Prerequisite

1. Download and install JMP.

    *JMP download and installation information will come soon as we are still waiting for Rotman JMP Pro license for the 2023-2024 school year.*
    
    Note that the Rotman licensed JMP is Windows only. Mac users may consider installing a virtualization software such as [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com){target="_blank"} so you could run Windows apps on a Mac. If you have any questions about the virtualization software, you may contact [Rotman IT Helpdesk](mailto:helpdesk@rotman.utoronto.ca).

2. Get familiar with JMP navigation and basic use.

    * Launch JMP Pro. Take a quick 5-minute hands-on tutorial under the menu "Help > Tutorials > Beginners Tutorial".
    
    * Go through 3 online video tutorials (about 50mins in total) at [Getting Started for Academics](https://www.jmp.com/en_us/events/ondemand/webcasts/academic/getting-started-for-academics.html){target="_blank"}. Note the datasets used in the tutorials can be found in JMP under the menu "Help > Sample Data Library".
