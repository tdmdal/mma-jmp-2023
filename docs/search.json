Click the “Software” tile, and then follow the JMP “Download” link.\nUnzip the downloaded file into a temporary folder. Run the setup utility (“JMP\\JMP_Pro\\17_0\\Windows\\jmppro__1700__win.exe”).\n(Optional) After installation, launch JMP Pro 17. Under the menu “File &gt; Preferences &gt; JMP Updates”, click “Check Now” and follow the instruction to update JMP from version 17.0.0 to 17.1.0. (You would need to creat a SAS profile by signing up SAS support community, download an update pacakge, and install it.)\n\nNote that the Rotman licensed JMP is Windows only. Mac users may consider installing a virtualization software such as Parallels Desktop so you could install Windows and run Windows apps on a Mac. (This solution is not free as you would need to pay for both Parallels and Windows OS.) If you have any questions about the virtualization software, you may contact Rotman IT Helpdesk. If you don’t have time to work out the virtualization approach, a temporary solution for Mac users is to simply download and install a 1-month free trial of JMP Pro for Mac for this workshop.\nGet familiar with JMP navigation and basic use.\n\nLaunch JMP Pro. Take a quick 5-minute hands-on tutorial under the menu “Help &gt; Tutorials &gt; Beginners Tutorial”.\nGo through 3 online video tutorials (about 50mins in total) at Getting Started for Academics. Note the datasets used in the tutorials can be found in JMP under the menu “Help &gt; Sample Data Library”.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides\n\nSession 1 (Slides)\n\nWorkflow overview\nBasic data manipulation\n\nSession 2 (Slides)\n\nJoin data tables\nJMP graphing\n\nSession 3 (Slides)\n\nModelling\nJMP Journal\nJMP Scripting Language\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n       Download and unzip the datasets for the workshop (data.zip).\n\n\n\nGetting-started Resources\n\nGetting Started for Academics\nJMP Learning Library\nStatistical Thinking for Industrial Problem Solving (Click Enroll for Free, and then choose Audit Only for free access.)\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
